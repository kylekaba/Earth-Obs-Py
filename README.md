# Python Visualization for Earth Science Tutorial Scripts.

Datasets can be downloaded from: [http://sigma.umd.edu/resmaili/EarthSciViz/](http://sigma.umd.edu/resmaili/EarthSciViz/)

This code is intended to be run alongside the workbook. As of right now, the code must be downloaded and run locally. I plan to add interactive examples soon.
